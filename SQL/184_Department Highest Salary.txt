# Write your MySQL query statement below
#SELECT Employee.Name AS Employee,MAX(Salary) AS Salary FROM  Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId

#SELECT Department.Name AS Department,Employee.Name AS Employee,MAX(Salary) FROM Employee INNER JOIN Department ON  #Employee.DepartmentId=Department.Id GROUP BY DepartmentId
#SELECT Department.Name as Department,Employee.Name AS Employee ,Salary  FROM  Employee ,Department where Employee.DepartmentId=Department.Id
#GROUP BY DepartmentId limit 0,1
#还是对sql语句很不熟啊 groupby的使用真不会
SELECT Department.Name as Department,Employee.Name AS Employee ,Salary  FROM  Employee ,Department 
where Employee.DepartmentId=Department.Id and Salary in (Select max(Salary ) FROM  Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId )
